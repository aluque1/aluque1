### Hello there 

#### Short introduction
Right now I am a studying Computer Engineering at Universidad Complutense of Madrid. Most of the repositories in this github (for now) are part of small proyects that we have to do for our subjects.

Most of the code is here to be shared and accessed by students that are currently taking said subjects and so they can have a look at the code, I try to have it commented to explain some more complicated stuff, or things that I personally didn't understand right off the bat.
