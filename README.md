## Hello there 

### Short introduction
Right now I am a studying [Computer Engineering at Universidad Complutense of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/grado-ingenieriadecomputadores). Most of the repositories in this github (for now) are part of small proyects that we have to do for our subjects.

Most of the code is here to be shared and accessed by students that are currently taking said subjects and so they can have a look at the code, I try to have it commented to explain some more complicated stuff, or things that I personally didn't understand right off the bat.

## Programming languages I have experience with
- `C` Used it for sockets, file management and a small [Shell](https://github.com/aluque1/ASO/tree/main/ejercicioShell), programming of small embedded systems on a S3C44BOX microcontroller and Embest S3CEV40 development board. Currently learning how to program distributed systems
- `C++` Mainly used to solve algorithm problems in [[FAL]]
- `VHDL` Learnt how to program small systems with `Vivado`
- `Java` Used to learn OOP in the subject [TP1](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/grado-ingenieriadecomputadores-plan-805481) & [TP2](https://www.ucm.es/estudios/grado-ingenieriadecomputadores-plan-805482)
